## About

A small template of a API/Bot running a bridge between two Ethereum chains. The bot was built using Javascript, Express.js, Web3 and Infura and other node providers of choice to connect to desirable chain. Moreover, this template also comes with a truffle setup and dummy contract ready to be deployed once wallet is connected. This bot is connected to a React.js and Next.js frontend with pertaining information of contract address, value and status. Extra fields can be added and modified with more customization on contract and bot information. All data is saved to a global state setup using Mobx. Metamask wallet support comes built-in but more can be added if desired.
